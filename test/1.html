			Unlike Consulting Services where our objective is to help our clients in setting up analytics capabilities, here we help the clients by actually developing the requisite analytical models to support/augment the internal decision-making process.
		</p>
		<p>
			We execute analytics projects primarily using our proprietary research in the area of data sciences, analytical techniques (from standard statistical techniques like regression analysis to Machine learning based models/techniques), suitable technologies and most importantly based on our domain knowledge of working in the financial sector.

		</p>
		<p>
Our domain and functional expert work in a collaborative approach with the client to provide a meaningful definition to the problems and requirements in accordance with the right business context. We have robust processes that address every phase of an end-to-end analytics cycle. Based on industry standards, these processes guarantee quality outputs.

		</p>
		<p>
We use proprietary data exploration tools, data models and model implementation tools to ensure that the solutions are delivered in the least possible time. Our relentless drive to capture its experience and expertise into products and tools ensures that the clients always have the advantage in terms of faster implementation and reduced efforts on part of companyâ€™s staff.

			At Auronova, traditional statistics like regression, survival analysis is combined with modern techniques like neural networks, decision trees and genetic algorithms to increase the accuracy of the predictive models. Most of our experts have strong mathematical background ensuring strong foundation in analytics.
